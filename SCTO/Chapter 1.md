# Chapter 1: Introduction to the research field

### Privacy-Preserving Data Mining (PPDM)

**Privacy-Preserving Data Mining (PPDM)** is a research field that focuses on developing algorithms and techniques to extract useful knowledge from data while ensuring that sensitive information remains confidential. This field is becoming increasingly important due to the proliferation of data in various domains such as healthcare, finance, and social networks.

## Key Aspects of PPDM

### Data Anonymization

This involves modifying the data in such a way that individual records cannot be traced back. Techniques such as k-anonymity, l-diversity, and t-closeness are used for this purpose.

### Secure Multi-party Computation

This is a subfield of cryptography that enables multiple parties to compute a function over their inputs while keeping those inputs private.

### Differential Privacy

This is a system for publicly sharing information about a dataset by describing the patterns of groups within the dataset while withholding information about individuals in the dataset.

### Federated Learning

This is a machine learning approach where a model is trained across multiple decentralized devices or servers holding local data samples, without exchanging them.

The goal of PPDM is to balance the trade-off between data utility (the ability to perform accurate data analysis) and data privacy (the protection of sensitive information). It’s a challenging and exciting field with many open research questions and practical applications.
